# My Website
	** This is my website! **
  ## Here I talk about my academic and personal history! As you can see I love languages and because of that I had the opportunity to visit:
1. Spain
2. The UK
3. Per√π
## Because of this, I also had the opportunity to attend *The University of Geneva*. Here you can find more about this one of a kind university: [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).
