          <div class="card"><h1>The "Hatter"</h1>
          <p>First, I decided to do a search on the "Word List" tab. Here, I found that this character is at position 90, meanwhile in the Italian version is at position 63.</p>
          <p>Because of this, we can say that this name is more frequent in the Italian book than the English one. 
            Moreover, we can see that character’s name has been accurately translated with the name "Cappellaio”.</p>
            <p>Then I used the parameter "Concordance Plot".
              It was found that the character appears with 56 hits, which makes it the character between the three that were exanimated the one that appears the most. It appears since the middle of the book and in the ¾ part of the novel.
              No discrepancy was found in the Italian version.</p>
              <img class=image3 src="../images/PlotHatter.png" alt="image of the Concordance Plot of the Hatter in the English version of the book"><br>
              <p>Then I used the tab Clusters/N-Grams
                I noticed that the words that follow "Hatter" are verbs like "grumbled", "trembled", "dropped". There are verbs that describe his emotions and actions. 
                I could see an almost literal translation of these words in the Italian version.</p>
                <p>Finally, I used the “Collocates” tab.
                  I found out that the word that were more likely to appear next to "Hatter" have a more negative connotation than the other characters. 
                  They are words like "rudeness", "mournfully", and "wreched". The same words are present in the Italian version, although it should be noted that the register used is higher than in the original version. 
                  </p>

        <div class="column">
          <div class="card"><h1>The "Rabbit"</h1>
            <p>Then I decided to analyze the “Rabbit” character.
              On the "Word List" tab I found that this character is at position 110, meanwhile in the Italian version is at position 83.</p>
            <p>Once again, we can say that this name is more frequent in the Italian book than the English one. 
              Moreover, thanks to the tab “Concordance”, that allows me to see the word with a bit more context, I found out that that the character’s name originally called W. Rabbit was translated with Coniglio B. In this case, the name and the surname were inverted for translation purposes.</p>
              <p>Then, I used the parameter "Concordance Plot".
                It was found that the character appears with 53 hits, which makes it the second most popular characters between the ones that are examined in this page. Moreover, I noticed that this character’s presence is more consistent since it appears at the beginning, middle and end of the book.
                In the Italian version, there are however 50 hits, which can be explained with the use of metaphors instead of the name
                </p>
                <p><img class=image3 src="../images/PlotRabbit.png" alt="image of the Concordance Plot of the Rabbit in the English version of the book"></p>
                <p>Then I used the tab Clusters/N-Grams
                  I noticed that the words that follow the "Rabbit" are verbs like "jumping", "trotting", "hurrying". These are verbs of movement. 
                  In the Italian version, we note the presence of the adjective "bianco" (white) and the verbs of the movements, but more general as "giunse", "faceva", "fosse arrivato".</p>
                  <p>Finally, I used the “Collocates” tab.
                    I found out that the word that were more likely to appear next to "Rabbit" refer to his actions, "trotting", "hurrying", and "white", and "hole". The same words are present in the Italian version with the addition of words such as "occhiali", and "occhiando" (glasses, and seeing with the eyes).</p>

        <div class="column">
          <div class="card"><h1>The "March Hare"</h1>
            <p>Last but not least, I decided to analyze the “March Hare” character.
              On the "Word List" tab I found that this character is at position 143, meanwhile in the Italian version is at position 133. 
              </p>
            <p>Also in this case, thanks to the tab “Concordance”, that allows me to see more context, I found out that that the character’s name was translated with “Lepre Marzolina”. In this case, the idiom “Mad as a March Hare” was not maintained in the Italian version, but a literal translation was preferred instead.
            </p>
              <p>Later, I used the parameter "Concordance Plot".
                It was found that the character appears with 34 hits. Moreover, I noticed that this character’s presence is present only in the middle and at the end of the book
                In the Italian version, there are however 31 hits.
                </p>
                <p><img class="image3" src="../images/PlotMarch.png" alt="Image of the Concordance Plot of the March Hare in the English version of the book"></p>
                <p>Then I used the tab Clusters/N-Grams
                  I noticed that the words that follow the "March Hare" are verbs like "said", "interrupted", and quotations marks, symbolizing the prominent presence of this character in the famous not-anniversary scene 
                  Strangely, in the Italian version we see only the word “Marzolina”.
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, I used the “Collocates” tab.
                    I found out that the word that were more likely to appear next to character’s name refer to objects present in the not-anniversary scene such as “spoon", "fork", and "teacups”. The same words are present in the Italian version.
